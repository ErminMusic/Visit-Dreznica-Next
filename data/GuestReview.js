        description: `Amazing place to stay. The owner Dino is the friendliest, most helpful person you can meet and genuinely wants you to enjoy yourself in Drežnica. I had a cold during my stay and he brought everything I needed from the city and served me tea and soup.\nThe accommodation rooms were exactly as the pictures let me expect, even with the most amazing scenery. The soul can really rest in these landscapes. On the other side of the bridge, a restaurant and a train stop literally outside the yard area.\n It's also convenient to get there by bus( I come from Mostar), for those who don't have their own car. I heard that several guests have extended their stay and I'm not surprised at all, because there is just something magical about this place. I highly recommend it!\n`,

I work remotely and the internet worked really well for my online call needs, in between I would just jump in the river to cool down from the unforgiving summer heat or just catch a boat ride with Dino.\nIt is convenient that the train stops at the very property so you can travel easily from and to Sarajevo or Mostar and it is really a beautiful train ride! Generally, Dino was always willing to help with whatever I needed and show me around town. \nThe cherry on top of the cake? Dino's Mom Sabina cooks THE BEST meals! Being breakfast lunch or dinner, it was just delicious. I am really thankful I got to spend these two weeks here and I most definitely will be back! P.S.: Dino is best known as Dinosaurio!\n`,

        description: `One of the best places I have ever stayed in. Dino and his mom were super nice and very welcoming. You immediately feel like you're at home. \nMrs. Sabina, Dino's mom, is an incredible cook (the best cevapi I've had were hers, and I tried a bunch). Dino offered me a boat ride to show me around. You can swim in the lake, and the water is very clean and not cold.\nDino was always helpful and there when I needed anything. He even offered to come and pick me up from Mostar and drive me around to show me the other side of Drežnica. \nDrežnica's nature is simply breathtaking. When you're there, you can't help but feel a profound sense of tranquility and overwhelming peace.\n`,

        description: `The apartment is located in front of the river, i.e. on the Confluence of two rivers. The view is perfect. And If you like trains there is also a railway track in front of the house, but it is not noisy.\n Even though there is a shared bathroom it was very clean and well equipped. Dino and his mother are more than friendly hosts. Dino provided us with a boat cruise which was very peaceful in the magnificent nature between mountains, an unforgettable experience. \nHis mother prepared delicious buns with chocolate cream. The room, linens, and towels were very clean. I have really enjoyed the stay.\n`,

        description: `The location deserves a 10+10 as a vote. Fantastic. Don't miss the chance to stay at Dino's and his family's apartment. You are greeted by extraordinary people who will make you really feel at home.\nThe beauty of the view from your room is indescribable for how beautiful it is. Excellent breakfast is served in the garden, a stone's throw from the river. Highly recommended for families with children in my opinion. \nI had a really good time and will definitely be back. Again, for what you pay you will be satisfied and enthusiastic. Excellent value for money.\n`,
